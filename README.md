 Introduction :
The provided Arduino code creates a system that dynamically adjusts the brightness of an LED strip based on ambient light levels and user preferences.
It utilizes an Arduino Uno along with a light-dependent resistor (LDR) as the light sensor, a potentiometer for user input, and an LED strip for illumination.
The code continuously reads data from the LDR and the potentiometer, mapping the potentiometer's input to control the LED brightness. 
This functionality allows the system to maintain optimal lighting conditions in a room by automatically adjusting the LED brightness according to ambient light levels and user settings.
